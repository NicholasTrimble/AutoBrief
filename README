# AutoBrief — Smart Project Update Dashboard | Python · Streamlit

AutoBrief is a beginner-friendly Python project that simulates project updates from GitHub, Jira, and Slack, and generates concise stakeholder summaries in an interactive Streamlit dashboard. It was built as a learning project to explore data aggregation, simple AI summarization logic, and dashboard visualization.

## Features

- Aggregates simulated updates from multiple sources (commits, issues/PRs, Jira tasks, Slack messages).
- Generates one-line updates for easy reading.
- Produces a simple deterministic summary for stakeholders (Completed, Blockers, Next Steps).
- Interactive dashboard using Streamlit with the ability to refresh simulated data.
- Includes a unit test to ensure the simulated data is structured correctly.

What I Learned

How to structure a project into modular Python files to make it easy to maintain and understand.

How to simulate multiple data sources (GitHub, Jira, Slack) for testing and dashboards.

Basic techniques for aggregating and summarizing data, even without complex AI.

How to build an interactive Streamlit dashboard and manage session state.

Writing simple unit tests to verify data structure.

Problem-solving: I learned the value of breaking complicated code into small, readable steps, especially as a beginner.
